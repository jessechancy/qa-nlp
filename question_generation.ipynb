it must be evolved from a Magikarp (much like other Pokémon games) and requires 400 Magikarp candies to evolve, more than any other Pokémon in the game.', 'In Pokkén Tournament and its deluxe Switch version, Gyarados has been shown in the Magikarp Festival as one of these arenas as only a background character, spectating a battle between the playable fighter Pokémon.', 'In anime\\nIn the anime, Gyarados first appeared in Pokémon -
